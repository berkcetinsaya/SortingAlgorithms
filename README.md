# Sorting
I created a program which has all sorting algorithms. There are three submodules. These submodules are about creating arrays as sorted, reversed and random. These arrays are written to files which are next to the .out file. This program calculates and prints those submodules' times. It is written in cpp. And there is a command line video [link][1].
