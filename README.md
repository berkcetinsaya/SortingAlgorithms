# Sorting Algorithms

<div style="text-align: justify"> 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Analysis of Algorithms is the area of computer science that provides tools to analyze the efficiency of different methods of solutions.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It recognizes limitations of various algorithms for solving a problem, to understand relationship between problem size and running time, to learn how to analyze an algorithm's running time without coding it, to learn techniques for writing more efficient code and to recognize bottlenecks in code as well as which parts of code are easiest to optimize.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This README file divided into three part. In the first part, I am going to explain all codes and complexities of the sorting algorithms such as the best, worst and average cases. Secondly, I will show you a table which contains the average execution times with maximum and minimum times. In the last part, I will leave some comments about efficiency of the sorting algorithms.

> #### The algorithms used in this project:
>
> - Bubble sort
> - Insertion sort
> - Selection sort
> - Quick sort ̰
> - Heap sort
> - Merge sort

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
First of all, I would like to start with the bubble sort and explain my code. For example, we have an array that includes five numbers “4 2 5 8 6“. Now, there are two for loops and one if statement. If statement checks that an index of the array is greater than the following index. If it is, they swap their positions and continue to next.
